# Start Session

Initialize your AI development session and begin working on tasks.

---

## Operation Types

| Marker | Meaning | Executor |
|--------|---------|----------|
| `[AI]` | PowerShell/Python scripts or tool calls executed by AI | You (AI) |
| `[USER]` | Skills executed by user | User |

---

## Initialization `[AI]`

### Step 1: Understand Development Workflow

First, read the workflow guide and the project-level collaboration rules:

```powershell
Get-Content .\.trellis\workflow.md
Get-Content AGENTS.md
```

**Follow the instructions in `workflow.md` and `AGENTS.md`** - they contain:
- Core principles (Read Before Write, Follow Standards, etc.)
- File system structure
- Development process
- Best practices
- Project-specific collaboration and documentation rules

> **Important for skill edits**:
> If you modify an existing `SKILL.md`, keep additions in the file's original language.
> Do not turn reusable skills into project-specific temporary checklists with one-off module names or file paths.

### Step 2: Get Current Context

```powershell
python .\.trellis\scripts\get_context.py
```

This shows: developer identity, git status, current task (if any), active tasks.

### Step 3: Read Guidelines Index

```powershell
Get-Content .\.trellis\spec\frontend\index.md  # Frontend guidelines
Get-Content .\.trellis\spec\backend\index.md   # Backend guidelines
Get-Content .\.trellis\spec\guides\index.md    # Thinking guides
```

> **Important**: The index files are navigation — they list the actual guideline files (e.g., `error-handling.md`, `conventions.md`, `mock-strategies.md`).
> At this step, just read the indexes to understand what's available.
> When you start actual development, you MUST go back and read the specific guideline files relevant to your task, as listed in the index's Pre-Development Checklist.

### Step 4: Report and Ask

Report what you learned and ask: "What would you like to work on?"

## Task Classification

When user describes a task, classify it:

| Type | Criteria | Workflow |
|------|----------|----------|
| **Question** | User asks about code, architecture, or how something works | Answer directly |
| **Trivial Fix** | Typo fix, comment update, single-line change, < 5 minutes | Direct Edit |
| **Simple Task** | Clear goal, 1-2 files, well-defined scope | Quick confirm → Task Workflow |
| **Complex Task** | Vague goal, multiple files, architectural decisions | **Brainstorm → Task Workflow** |

### Decision Rule

> **If in doubt, use Brainstorm + Task Workflow.**
>
> Task Workflow ensures code-specs are injected to the right context, resulting in higher quality code.
> The overhead is minimal, but the benefit is significant.

> **Subtask Decomposition**: If brainstorm reveals multiple independent work items,
> consider creating subtasks using `--parent` flag or `add-subtask` command.
> See the brainstorm skill's Step 8 for details.

### Behavior Change Gate

Before entering Task Workflow, classify the change as `L0` / `L1` / `L2` using `.trellis/workflow.md`.

- `L0`: No external behavior change. Continue with the existing Task Workflow.
- `L1`: Behavior change in a bounded module. Do **not** go straight to PRD/Research. First run:
  1. `openspec new change <slug>`
  2. `superpowers:brainstorming` to create or complete `proposal/spec`
  3. `openspec validate --strict --type change <slug>`
  4. `superpowers:writing-plans` to produce the implementation plan
- `L2`: Same as `L1`, plus required `design.md`. Multi-agent review happens after implementation in the review gate.

Only return to the Trellis Task Workflow after the spec and plan gates are complete.

Before Phase 2, always complete this Trellis handoff:

1. Update `openspec/changes/<slug>/tasks.md` with the high-level execution checklist
2. Create or bind a Trellis task directory
3. Ensure `prd.md` summarizes the approved `proposal/spec/design/plan`
4. Add the approved OpenSpec artifacts and plan into task context

- If the task came from **Simple Task**, resume with **Path B Step 2 (Create Task Directory)** and **Step 3 (Write PRD)**, then do the Trellis handoff above and continue to Phase 2.
- If the task came from **Brainstorm**, reuse the brainstorm-created task directory and PRD, then do the same Trellis handoff and continue with **Path A / Phase 2**.

---

## Question / Trivial Fix

For questions or trivial fixes, work directly:

1. Answer question or make the fix
2. If code was changed, follow the current session convention for verification, commit, and `$record-session`

---

## Simple Task

For simple, well-defined tasks:

1. Quick confirm: "I understand you want to [goal]. Shall I proceed?"
2. If no, clarify and confirm again
3. Determine whether the task is `L0`, `L1`, or `L2`.
4. **If it is `L1/L2`, complete the Behavior Change Gate first. After that, execute Path B Step 2 and Step 3, complete the Trellis handoff, then continue with Phase 2.**
5. **If it is `L0`, execute ALL steps below without stopping. Do NOT ask for additional confirmation between steps.**
   - Create task directory (Phase 1 Path B, Step 2)
   - Write PRD (Step 3)
   - Research codebase (Phase 2, Step 5)
   - Configure context (Step 6)
   - Activate task (Step 7)
   - Implement (Phase 3, Step 8)
   - Check quality (Step 9)
   - Complete (Step 10)

---

## Complex Task - Brainstorm First

For complex or vague tasks, **automatically start the brainstorm process** — do NOT skip directly to implementation.

See `$brainstorm` for the full process. Summary:

1. **Acknowledge and classify** - State your understanding
2. **Create task directory** - Track evolving requirements in `prd.md`
3. **Ask questions one at a time** - Update PRD after each answer
4. **Propose approaches** - For architectural decisions
5. **Confirm final requirements** - Get explicit approval
6. **If behavior changes are involved, complete the Behavior Change Gate**
7. **Proceed to Task Workflow** - Reuse the brainstorm-created task directory/PRD, complete the Trellis handoff, then continue from Phase 2 with clear requirements and plan

---

## Task Workflow (Development Tasks)

**Why this workflow?**
- Run a dedicated research pass before coding
- Configure specs in jsonl context files
- Implement using injected context
- Verify with a separate check pass
- Result: Code that follows project conventions automatically

### Overview: Two Entry Points

```
From Brainstorm (Complex Task):
  PRD confirmed → Research → Configure Context → Activate → Implement → Check → Complete

From Simple Task:
  Confirm → Create Task → Write PRD → Research → Configure Context → Activate → Implement → Check → Complete
```

**Key principle: Research happens AFTER requirements are clear (PRD exists).**

---

### Phase 1: Establish Requirements

#### Path A: From Brainstorm (skip to Phase 2)

PRD and task directory already exist from brainstorm. Skip directly to Phase 2.

#### Path B: From Simple Task

**Step 1: Confirm Understanding** `[AI]`

Quick confirm:
- What is the goal?
- What type of development? (frontend / backend / fullstack)
- Any specific requirements or constraints?

If unclear, ask clarifying questions.

**Step 2: Create Task Directory** `[AI]`

```powershell
$TASK_DIR = python .\.trellis\scripts\task.py create "<title>" --slug <name>
```

**Step 3: Write PRD** `[AI]`

Create `prd.md` in the task directory with:

```markdown
# <Task Title>

## Goal
<What we're trying to achieve>

## Requirements
- <Requirement 1>
- <Requirement 2>

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] <Criterion 1>
- [ ] <Criterion 2>

## Technical Notes
<Any technical decisions or constraints>
```

---

### Phase 2: Prepare for Implementation (shared)

> Both paths converge here. PRD and task directory must exist before proceeding.

**Step 4: Code-Spec Depth Check** `[AI]`

If the task touches infra or cross-layer contracts, do not start implementation until code-spec depth is defined.

Trigger this requirement when the change includes any of:
- New or changed command/API signatures
- Database schema or migration changes
- Infra integrations (storage, queue, cache, secrets, env contracts)
- Cross-layer payload transformations

Must-have before proceeding:
- [ ] Target code-spec files to update are identified
- [ ] Concrete contract is defined (signature, fields, env keys)
- [ ] Validation and error matrix is defined
- [ ] At least one Good/Base/Bad case is defined

**Step 5: Research the Codebase** `[AI]`

Based on the confirmed PRD, run a focused research pass and produce:

1. Relevant spec files in `.trellis/spec/`
2. Existing code patterns to follow (2-3 examples)
3. Files that will likely need modification

Use this output format:

```markdown
## Relevant Specs
- <path>: <why it's relevant>

## Code Patterns Found
- <pattern>: <example file path>

## Files to Modify
- <path>: <what change>
```

**Step 6: Configure Context** `[AI]`

Initialize default context:

```powershell
python .\.trellis\scripts\task.py init-context $TASK_DIR <type>
# type: backend | frontend | fullstack
```

Add specs found in your research pass:

```powershell
# For each relevant spec and code pattern:
python .\.trellis\scripts\task.py add-context $TASK_DIR implement "<path>" "<reason>"
python .\.trellis\scripts\task.py add-context $TASK_DIR check "<path>" "<reason>"
```

If this task came through the Behavior Change Gate, add the approved artifacts before coding:

```powershell
python .\.trellis\scripts\task.py add-context $TASK_DIR implement "openspec/changes/<slug>/proposal.md" "Approved change proposal"
python .\.trellis\scripts\task.py add-context $TASK_DIR implement "openspec/changes/<slug>/specs/.../spec.md" "Approved behavior spec"
python .\.trellis\scripts\task.py add-context $TASK_DIR implement "openspec/changes/<slug>/design.md" "Approved design for L2 changes"
python .\.trellis\scripts\task.py add-context $TASK_DIR implement "docs/superpowers/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.md" "Approved implementation plan"
python .\.trellis\scripts\task.py add-context $TASK_DIR check "openspec/changes/<slug>/specs/.../spec.md" "Check implementation against approved spec"
python .\.trellis\scripts\task.py add-context $TASK_DIR check "docs/superpowers/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.md" "Check implementation against approved plan"
```

**Step 7: Activate Task** `[AI]`

```powershell
python .\.trellis\scripts\task.py start $TASK_DIR
```

This sets `.current-task` so hooks can inject context.

---

### Phase 3: Execute (shared)

**Step 8: Implement** `[AI]`

Implement the task described in `prd.md`.

- Follow all specs injected into implement context
- Keep changes scoped to requirements
- Run the relevant project verification command before finishing

**Step 9: Check Quality** `[AI]`

Run a quality pass against check context:

- Review all code changes against the specs
- Fix issues directly
- Ensure the relevant project verification command passes

**Step 10: Complete** `[AI]`

1. Verify the relevant project verification command passes
2. Report what was implemented
3. Follow the current session convention for completion:
   - Test the changes
   - Have the agreed executor commit business-code changes
   - Run `$record-session` to record this session

---

## Continuing Existing Task

If `get_context.py` shows a current task:

1. Read the task's `prd.md` to understand the goal
2. Check `task.json` for current status and phase
3. Ask user: "Continue working on <task-name>?"

If yes, resume from the appropriate step (usually Step 7 or 8).

## Key Principle

> **Code-spec context is injected, not remembered.**
>
> The Task Workflow ensures agents receive relevant code-spec context automatically.
> This is more reliable than hoping the AI "remembers" conventions.
